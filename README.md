My dream solution to organizing my paper collections.
Proof of concept

Ingredients:
- neo4j: graph database for storage
- cermine: to parse pdfs for full text search
- scholar.py: to fetch metadata on papers
- pdfjs: as in-browser pdf reader
  - handcrafted highlights/inline comments (synchronized to the db)
- vue.jl: for the fronted
- a tagging system: i just love tags
